
GwtFuzzer v0.1

This is a proof of concept fuzzer which was presented at OWASP Appsec DC. This script
utilizes the GDS Burp API and GWTParser class in order to filter out GWT RPC requests
from a Burp Proxy log and programmatically fuzz user-input. The presentation can be
downloaded at http://www.owasp.org/images/7/77/Attacking_Google_Web_Toolkit.ppt.

GDS Burp API can be downloaded here: http://mwielgoszewski.github.com/burpee/


NOTE:
Both Libraries must be added to your PYTHONPATH.
